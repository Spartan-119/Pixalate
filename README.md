The TalkingData AdTracking dataset was put up on Kaggle in 2017 as a competition by the Chinese company TalkingData, which processes three billion clicks every day, 90% of which are possibly illegitimate. [16]. Its method of detecting and preventing click fraud is to monitor and analyze usersâ€™ click journeys across their portfolios; IP addresses that generate many clicks but never install apps are flagged. A blacklist of IP addresses and devices is then created based on this information. The goal of the competition was to develop the best model for predicting whether a user would proceed to install an app after clicking on an ad and to distinguish fraudulent clicks from benign ones. The data provided were extensive, comprising a total of 203,694,359 real-time ad click records captured on a mobile platform, with an overall size of roughly 7 GB over four days. Table 4 illustrates the statistics of the TalkingData dataset.
